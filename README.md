# PROJECT INTRODUCTION

This project simulates an e-commerce ecosystem that includes a gaming-themed website called **LEVEL UP**, and a **Bank** to handle all financial transactions. The website allows users to purchase gaming products based on their experience level, starting with beginner items like gaming mice, keyboards, and controllers, progressing to intermediate products like gaming displays, and finally advanced equipment such as VR headsets and steering wheels.

The system supports both suppliers and customers. Suppliers can create accounts, add their products, and supply them to customers. Customers can browse and purchase products while making payments through the integrated bank system. After a purchase, suppliers fulfill the orders and pay 20% of their earnings to the e-commerce platform as a commission. Both suppliers and customers must link their bank accounts during signup to facilitate transactions.

The **Bank** operates as a separate entity, managing all transactions between the parties. Users can log in to the bank system to view their transaction history, including credits and debits. All interactions between the e-commerce platform, suppliers, and the bank are carried out using APIs, ensuring smooth functionality across the ecosystem.

This project focuses on simulating the core functionality of an e-commerce system, showcasing the interaction between users, suppliers, and a bank in an organized setup.
